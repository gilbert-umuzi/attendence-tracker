# attendence-tracker
Track learner attendance for remote learning based on learner manager inputs from daily standups. 

## Overview
This project aims to track the attendance of learners engaged in Umuzi's remote learning environment. Managers are able to input attendance details via daily standups, which are then aggregated and stored in an Airtable database. Learners and managers receive automated messages for absences, leave, and weekly summaries. This platform serves to enhance accountability and facilitate monitoring of both punctuality and absence rates.

## Features
**Historical Data:** Transformation of past attendance data from Google Forms to Airtable.
